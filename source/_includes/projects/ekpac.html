		<p class="project__description">Ekpac started in Hong Kong as seafaring merchants and traders, evolving over the course of a century into an industrial conglomerate specializing in large scale construction and manufacturing. The company had ambitions to grow the sourcing division into one of their core lines of business, and a standalone marketing website was commissioned as part of the promotional efforts. The nature of sourcing for construction and manufacturing requires a sales force to communicate and transact business between multiple industrial organizations for any one project. This means that generating sales comes down to the expertise of the sales team. The website was designed according around the purpose of reinforcing the company’s reputation for quality and service, as well as making their process and approach as candid as possible to stand out in the opaque realm of China’s industrial sector. Additionally, a concept for a visual identity redesign was built and designed for Ekpac to explore the possibility of a broader refresh of the corporate brand.</p>
