			<p class="detail">Junior Chef Academy offers a one-of-a-kind extra-curricular learning experience for kids and teenagers, which happens to be a particularly crowded space in Hong Kong. Founder Judy Li subverts the typical recipe-based approach to cooking classes, instead teaching basic kitchen skills and simple preparations with a focus on nutritional, wholesome eating, giving her students a headstart on building healthy eating habits and self-sufficiency in the kitchen. This project was a joy to work on! The visual identity design struck a great balance between the playfulness of the class experience and the seriousness of underlying teachings. Print collateral and a landing page was created to promote their inaugural series of summer classes.</p>
