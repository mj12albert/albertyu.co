			<p class="detail">Junior Chef Academy offers a one-of-a-kind extra-curricular learning experience for kids and teenagers, which happens to be a particularly crowded space in Hong Kong. Founder Judy Li subverts the typical recipe-based approach to cooking classes, instead teaching basic kitchen skills and simple preparations with a focus on nutritional, wholesome eating, giving her students a headstart on building healthy eating habits and self-sufficiency in the kitchen. This project was a joy to work on! The visual identity design struck a great balance between the playfulness of the class experience and the seriousness of underlying teachings. Print collateral and a landing page was created to promote their inaugural series of summer classes.</p>

      <figcaption class="project__caption--jca project__caption--right">This fellow was Judy’s initial “self-portrait” of her brand, and somehow found its way into the our initial email conversations about plans for Junior Chef Academy. It provided a good starting point for discussing topics like personality, purpose, and values – the intangible qualities yet critical qualities that make a strong brand.</figcaption>

      <figcaption class="project__caption--jca project__caption--below right">The design challenge pretty much came down to putting a “fun twist” on education, which is probably by far the most common way that people position educational programs and activities for children. We approached this by eliminating the word “fun” from our vocabulary, and exploring typographical representations of Judy’s personality traits that really stood out. The casual, sophistication of Pacifico’s cursive letterforms, large strokes, and generous curves really puts a smile on your face, and captured exactly what we were looking for.</figcaption>

		<figure class="project__figure">
      <figcaption class="project__caption--jca project__caption--left">Practical, everyday skills is the most important thing Judy wanted to teach her students. As a pretty decent home-cook, I know from my own sweat and tears that practical experience and using good tools go hand-in-hand. The idea for Junior Chef Academy’s graphic identity began by repurposing this whisk.</figcaption>

			<figcaption class="project__caption--jca project__caption--right">Whisks happen to be a very common graphical device for anything related to food and cooking. Yet most cooks, celebrity, professional and amateur alike, would argue that the knife is a cook’s single most important tool. Judy believes that being practical in the kitchen means making use of all the tools at your disposal at the right time and occasion.</figcaption>

			<figcaption class="project__caption--jca project__caption--below left">We fashioned a a whole set of kitchen tools, which was tiled into a pattern, forming the backbone of Junior Chef Academy’s identity. Repetition is inherently pleasing to the eye, and the playfulness of the pattern took the edge off its stern arrangement. The solid strokes and gently edges of the pattern was informed by the letterforms of Pacifico, which was used as a titling font.</figcaption>
